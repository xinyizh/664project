# 664project
I would like to work on a project about European soccers. This project will store the data about the information of European players, the soccer teams, leagues, countries and the relevant matches, so the data models would be player, team, league, country and match. Soccer teams and countries, players and countries, and players and leagues are many-to-one relationships. Players and matches, teams and matches are all many-to-many relationships. Users can login the website and save the player/team/league/country/match they like. The website will show the user any new updates about their saved player/team/league/country/match. The website will also save the number of users that save the particular player/team/league/country/match and show the most popular on the home page.
